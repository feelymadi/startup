# 🎼 TuneChart

[My Notes](notes.md)

In short what I plan to create is letterboxd but for music. I want a place where you can rank songs and it will have a leaderboard for the week based on peoples ranking.


## 💿 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Do you ever feel stuck when you are listening to music? Do you ever want to freshen up your music taste by exploring your friends reccommendations? Or do you feel the oppisite and find certain songs so amazing that you want to share them with your friends? Well I decided to create a website to rank and discover music. When you find a song new song, you can hop on my website and rate the song. Weekly charts will keep you up to date with a community of music listeners reccomendations.

### Design

### Key features

- Allow user to rank a song
- Compile and update weekly chart based on users rankings

> [!NOTE]
> I feel there are many more features I could add but this is what I want to start with seeing as I am not very familiar with html or css

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will use html to structure my startup. It will layout all of the information that I want to display with relevant headers, links, and/or tables.
- **CSS** - CSS will allow me to deliver this information in a pretty and readable way. This is where the style will come from.
- **React** - This is how the user will interact with my page, to rank and search for songs.
- **Service** - Service will be how I store all of the rankings and charts. 
- **DB/Login** - A database will store user accounts and rankings. Login lets users access their account and their rankings.
- **WebSocket** - Using WebSocket will bring the site to life. It will allow for realtime updates to the weekly chart and will send notifications when new rankings are posted.
