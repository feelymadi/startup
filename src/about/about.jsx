            Do you ever feel stuck when listening to music? Do you want to
            freshen up your music taste by exploring your friends’ recommendations?
            Or do you feel the opposite and find certain songs so amazing that
            you want to share them?

            I created TuneChart as a way to rank and discover music. When you
            find a new song, you can hop on the site and rate it. Weekly charts
            keep you up to date with the community’s favorite songs.

            TuneChart lets you rank songs and keep up with the best music
            through a highest-ranked chart based on people’s ratings.
